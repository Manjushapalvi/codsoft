CodSoft Data Science Internship Project
Welcome to the CodSoft Data Science Internship repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for three exciting tasks that were undertaken during the internship program. The tasks include Titanic Survival Prediction, Iris Flower Classification, and Sales Prediction.

Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this task, we aimed to predict the survival status of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and fare. The predictive model was trained on historical data to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Task 2: Iris Flower Classification
The second task involves the classification of Iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers.

Task 3: Sales Prediction
The third task focuses on predicting sales using historical sales data. The dataset includes information such as product features, time of sale, and other relevant variables. The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future sales.
